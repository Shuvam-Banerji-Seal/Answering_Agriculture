# Security Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Successfully removed hardcoded Hugging Face token from git history and replaced with secure environment variable approach.

## What Was Done

### 1. Git History Cleanup
- Used `git filter-branch` to completely remove the notebook file with hardcoded token from all commit history
- This ensures the secret is not accessible in any previous commits
- Force-pushed the cleaned history to GitHub

### 2. Secure Implementation
- Replaced hardcoded token `"hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"` with `os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN')`
- Added import for `os` module
- Added warning message when environment variable is not set
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 3. File Updated
- `audio_stuff/farmers agentiic/it_finetunning.ipynb`: Now uses secure environment variable approach

### 4. Usage Instructions
To use the notebook securely:
```bash
export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
# or add to your .env file
echo "HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_token_here" >> .env
```

## Verification
- âœ… Repository successfully pushed to GitHub
- âœ… No secrets detected by GitHub's push protection
- âœ… Git history is clean of any hardcoded tokens
- âœ… Working tree is clean and up to date

## Security Best Practices Applied
1. Environment variables for sensitive data
2. Git history sanitization
3. Proper .gitignore patterns for secrets
4. Documentation of secure usage patterns

The repository is now secure and ready for collaboration! ðŸ”’
