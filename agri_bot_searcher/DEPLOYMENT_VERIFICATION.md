## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

### Multi-Agent System
- **6 Specialized Agents**: Crop specialist, disease expert, soil scientist, etc.
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Agents selected based on query content
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- **Result Synthesis**: Intelligent combination of agent responses

### Answer Modes
- **Detailed Mode** (default): Comprehensive analysis with context and explanations
- **Exact Mode** (`--exact`): Concise, practical advice with bullet points
- **Both modes include**: Inline citations, source verification, error handling

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.7+**: Core language with asyncio for concurrency
- **Ollama**: Local LLM inference with multiple model support
- **DuckDuckGo**: Web search integration for real-time information
- **Flask**: Optional web API for browser-based interaction
- **Docker**: Complete containerization for easy deployment

## üì¶ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Python Installation
```bash
cd agri_bot_searcher
./install.sh
python src/agriculture_chatbot.py --query "your question here"
```

### Option 2: Docker Container (Recommended)
```bash
cd agri_bot_searcher
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it agri-bot-searcher python src/agriculture_chatbot.py --query "your question here"
```

### Option 3: Web API
```bash
python src/web_api.py
# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration
- **config.yml**: Advanced settings, timeouts, agent parameters
- **requirements.txt**: All Python dependencies
- **Environment Variables**: Optional custom model and port settings

### Ollama Models
- **Default**: Uses available models on port 11434
- **Custom**: Configure additional instances in config.yml
